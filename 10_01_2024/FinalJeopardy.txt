Final Jeopardy:

Model the following logical data requirements with the ER modeling techniques (and best practices).

Projects are uniquely identified by a project id.
Each project has many tasks, and a given task can be associated to at most one project.
A task cannot be uniquely identified apart from the project it is associated to.
Each task has a task identifier which starts at 1 and increases with each successive task on the project (hence the task identifier is not unique across projects).
Lastly, we must also record the due date of each task that is associated to a project.
