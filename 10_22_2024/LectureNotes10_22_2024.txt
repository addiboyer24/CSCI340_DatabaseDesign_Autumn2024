6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL
One basic statement for retrieving information from a database:
SELECT statement.

SQL allows a 
table (relation) to have two or more tuples that are identical in all their attribute 
values. Hence, in general, an SQL table is not a set of tuples, because a set does not 
allow two identical members; rather, it is a multiset (sometimes called a bag) of 
tuples. Some SQL relations are constrained to be sets because a key constraint has 
been declared or because the DISTINCT option has been used with the SELECT statement (described later in this section). We should be aware of this distinction as we 
discuss the examples.

6.3.1 The SELECT-FROM-WHERE Structure 
of Basic SQL Queries

basic form of the select statement:
select-from-where block (mapping)

SELECT <attribute list>
FROM <table list>
WHERE <condition>;

where
■ <attribute list> is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by 
the query.
■ <table list> is a list of the relation names required to process the query.
■ <condition> is a conditional (Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples 
to be retrieved by the query.

logical comparison operators:
In SQL, the basic logical comparison operators for comparing attribute values with 
one another and with literal constants are =, <, <=, >, >=, and <>.

Query description: have class come up with some simple query.

Example here (see pdf and sql code):

SELECT - specifies the attributes that are to be retrieved (projection attributes) in relational algebra.

WHERE - specifies the boolean condition that must be true for any retrieved tuple (selection condition).

- tuple variable or iterator in the SQL query ranging or 
looping over each individual tuple in the EMPLOYEE table and evaluating the condition in the WHERE clause. Only those tuples that satisfy the condition—that is, 
those tuples for which the condition evaluates to TRUE after substituting their corresponding attribute values - are selected.

- a selection condition
that chooses the particular tuple of interest in the X table
i.e. Dname = ‘Research’

a join condition, 
because it combines two tuples: one from X and one from Y, 
whenever the value of attributeX in X is equal to the value of attributeY in 
Y.

i.e. attributeX (X) = attributeY (Y)

A query that involves only selection and join conditions plus projection attributes is 
known as a select-project-join query.

6.3.2 Ambiguous Attribute Names, Aliasing, 
Renaming, and Tuple Variables

In SQL, the same name can be used for two (or more) attributes as long as the 
attributes are in different tables (quiz question)*

If this is the case, and a multitable query refers to 
two or more attributes with the same name, we must qualify the attribute name 
with the relation name to prevent ambiguity.

do so by prefixing the relation name to the attribute name with a period
i.e. relationname.attributename

Ambiguity.
Fully qualified attribute names can be used for clarity even if there is no ambiguity in attribute names. Q1 can be rewritten as Q1′ below with fully qualified 
attribute names.

Clarity.
Fully qualified attribute names can be used for clarity even if there is no ambiguity in attribute names. Q1 can be rewritten as Q1′ below with fully qualified 
attribute names.

Aliases.
We can also rename the table names to shorter names by creating an alias for each table name to avoid repeated typing of long table names.

Aliases follow the keyword AS.

i.e. 
EMPLOYEE AS E(Fn, Mi, Ln, Ssn, Bd, Addr, Sex, Sal, Sssn, Dno)
in the FROM clause, Fn becomes an alias for Fname, Mi for Minit, Ln for Lname, and 
so on.

We can use this alias-naming or renaming mechanism in any SQL query to specify 
tuple variables for every table in the WHERE clause, whether or not the same relation needs to be referenced more than once. In fact, this practice is recommended 
since it results in queries that are easier to comprehend.

6.3.3 Unspecified WHERE Clause and Use of the Asterisk
- A missing WHERE clause indicates 
no condition on tuple selection; hence, all tuples of the relation specified in the 
FROM clause qualify and are selected for the query result.

If more than one relation is specified in the FROM clause and there is no WHERE clause, then the 
CROSS PRODUCT—all possible tuple combinations—of these relations is 
selected.

WARNING***
It is extremely important to specify every selection and join condition in the WHERE
clause; if any such condition is overlooked, incorrect and very large relations may 
result*

Selecting all the attributes:
- To retrieve all the attribute values of the selected tuples, we do not have to list the 
attribute names explicitly in SQL; we just specify an asterisk (*), which stands for all 
the attributes. The * can also be prefixed by the relation name or alias; for example, 
EMPLOYEE.* refers to all attributes of the EMPLOYEE table.

6.3.4 Tables as Sets in SQL
As we mentioned earlier, SQL usually treats a table not as a set but rather as a multiset; 
duplicate tuples can appear more than once in a table, and in the result of a query. 
SQL does not automatically eliminate duplicate tuples in the results of queries, for 
the following reasons:

Expensive, Might Want to See them, Don't want to eliminate duplicates in aggregates*

■ Duplicate elimination is an expensive operation. One way to implement it is 
to sort the tuples first and then eliminate duplicates.
■ The user may want to see duplicate tuples in the result of a query.
■ When an aggregate function (see Section 7.1.7) is applied to tuples, in most 
cases we do not want to eliminate duplicates.

SQL table with a key is restricted to being a set, since the key value must be distinct in each tuple.

DISTINCT - keyword used to eliminate duplicate tuples from the result of a SQL query.

In general, a query with SELECT 
DISTINCT eliminates duplicates, whereas a query with SELECT ALL does not.

SELECT = SELECT ALL (quiz question)*

Set Operations:

UNION
EXCEPT
INTERCEPT

- The relations resulting from these set operations are sets of tuples; that is, duplicate 
tuples are eliminated from the result. These set operations apply only to typecompatible relations, so we must make sure that the two relations on which we apply 
the operation have the same attributes and that the attributes appear in the same 
order in both relations.

6.3.5 Substring Pattern Matching and Arithmetic Operators
LIKE - comparison operator.
used for string pattern matching.

% replaces an arbitrary number of zero or more 
characters, and the underscore (_) replaces a single character (quiz question)*

ESCAPE:
a literal character in the string, the character 
should be preceded by an escape character

Another feature allows the use of arithmetic in queries. The standard arithmetic 
operators for addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (*), and division (/) can 
be applied to numeric values or attributes with numeric domains.

For string data types, the concatenate operator || can be used in a query to append 
two string values.

Another comparison operator, which can be used 
for convenience, is BETWEEN.

6.3.6 Ordering of Query Results
ORDER BY CLAUSE - SQL allows the user to order the tuples in the result of a query by the values of one 
or more of the attributes that appear in the query result

The default order is in ascending order of values. We can specify the keyword DESC
if we want to see the result in a descending order of values. The keyword ASC can be 
used to specify ascending order explicitly. For example, if we want descending 
alphabetical order on Dname and ascending order on Lname, Fname, the ORDER BY
clause of Q15 can be written as
ORDER BY D.Dname DESC, E.Lname ASC, E.Fname ASC

6.3.7 Discussion and Summary of 
Basic SQL Retrieval Queries

Updated anatomy of the SQL Query:

SELECT <attribute list>
FROM <table list>
[ WHERE <condition> ]
[ ORDER BY <attribute list> ];

6.4 INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE 
Statements in SQL

6.4.1 The INSERT Command

INSERT - most simple used to add a single tuple (row) to a relation (table).

We must specify the relation name and a list of values for the tuple.

The values 
should be listed in the same order in which the corresponding attributes were specified in the CREATE TABLE command. For example, to add a new tuple to the 
EMPLOYEE relation shown in Figure 5.5 and specified in the CREATE TABLE 
EMPLOYEE … command in Figure 6.1, we can use U1:

U1: INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE
VALUES ( ‘Richard’, ‘K’, ‘Marini’, ‘653298653’, ‘1962-12-30’, ‘98 
Oak Forest, Katy, TX’, ‘M’, 37000, ‘653298653’, 4 );

A second form of the INSERT statement allows the user to specify explicit attribute 
names that correspond to the values provided in the INSERT command.

However, the values must include all attributes with NOT 
NULL specification and no default value. Attributes with NULL allowed or DEFAULT
values are the ones that can be left out. 

U1A: INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (Fname, Lname, Dno, Ssn)
VALUES (‘Richard’, ‘Marini’, 4, ‘653298653’);

Attributes not specified in U1A are set to their DEFAULT or to NULL

Inserting Multiple Tuples (From Query, or Explicitly):

U3B: INSERT INTO WORKS_ON_INFO ( Emp_name, Proj_name, 
Hours_per_week )
SELECT E.Lname, P.Pname, W.Hours
FROM PROJECT P, WORKS_ON W, EMPLOYEE E
WHERE P.Pnumber = W.Pno AND W.Essn = E.Ssn;

6.4.2 The DELETE Command

The DELETE command removes tuples from a relation. It includes a WHERE
clause, similar to that used in an SQL query, to select the tuples to be deleted. 
Tuples are explicitly deleted from only one table at a time. However, the deletion 
may propagate to tuples in other relations if referential triggered actions are specified in the referential integrity constraints of the DDL (see Section 6.2.2).

zero, one, or many tuples may be deleted by a single DELETE command (quiz question)*
depending on the evaluation of the WHERE condition.

If no WHERE condition is supplied, all the tuples from the relation will be deleted, but the table will still exist.  You must drop the table to remove it from the schema.

i.e.
U4A: DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE Lname = ‘Brown’;

6.4.3 The UPDATE Command
The UPDATE command is used to modify attribute values of one or more selected 
tuples. 

a WHERE clause in the UPDATE command 
selects the tuples to be modified from a single relation. However, updating a primary key value may propagate to the foreign key values of tuples in other relations if such a referential triggered action is specified in the referential integrity constraints of the DDL (see Section 6.2.2). 

SET clause in the 
UPDATE command specifies the attributes to be modified and their new values.

Several tuples can be modified with a single UPDATE command.

In the SET
clause, the reference to the Salary attribute on the right refers to the old Salary
value before modification, and the one on the left refers to the new Salary value 
after modification:
U6: UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
WHERE Dno = 5;

It is also possible to specify NULL or DEFAULT as the new attribute value. Notice that 
each UPDATE command explicitly refers to a single relation only. To modify multiple relations, we must issue several UPDATE commands.
